## Overview

multi instance redis

## Module Description

If applicable, this section should have a brief description of the technology
the module integrates with and what that integration enables. This section
should answer the questions: "What does this module *do*?" and "Why would I use
it?"

If your module has a range of functionality (installation, configuration,
management, etc.) this is the time to mention it.

## Setup

### What redis affects

* manages redis package
* disables default redis service, on centos 7 also masks the systemd service
* manages as many services as redis instances

### Setup Requirements

This module requires pluginsync enabled

### Beginning with redis

```puppet
class { 'redis': }

redis::instance { '6666':
}
```

## Usage

Put the classes, types, and resources for customizing, configuring, and doing
the fancy stuff with your module here.

## Reference

Here, list the classes, types, providers, facts, etc contained in your module.
This section should include all of the under-the-hood workings of your module so
people know what the module is touching on their system but don't need to mess
with things. (We are working on automating this section!)

## Limitations

This is where you list OS compatibility, version compatibility, etc.

## Development

We are pushing to have acceptance testing in place, so any new feature should
have some test to check both presence and absence of any feature
